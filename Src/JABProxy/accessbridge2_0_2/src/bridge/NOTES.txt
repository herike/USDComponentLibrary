KNOWN PROBLEMS

--------------



The installer assumes the Program Files directory is located on the c:

drive. When this is changed via an environment variable, you must

do a manual install of the Java Access Bridge.



Registering, unregistering, then registering again for various of the

menus events will cause you to receive duplicate copies of the event.



You will not receive MenuCanceled (or PopupMenuCanceled) events.  To

determine that a menu has closed, look for MenuDeselected events.



GetAccessibleAt() may fail if you are querying for a coordinate other

than the mouse coordinate.  This bug in the Java Development Kit is 

fixed in Java 2 SDK 1.3.



If you are using a version of JAWS for Windows up to and including 

version 3.70.47 with Java2 SDK 1.3, you must not configure JFW to load 

as a service under Windows NT.  That combination will cause crashes.



Java Access Bridge v2.0.1 does not run with Java applications written 

with JDK 1.1.8.  To enable access to these applications, use the Java 

Access Bridge v1.0.2.



-------------

TIPS ON USAGE

-------------



Use State PropertyChange events to determine changes in menu item selection

(e.g. when the user arrows up/down within a menu).



Use ActiveDescendent PropertyChange events to determine changes in the

selected cell of a table.



Use the AccessibleValue support and Value PropertyChange events to track

the values of things like sliders, scroll bars, etc.



Use the AccessibleSelection support to determine which items are selected

in a List, Table, etc.  This is more efficient than enumerating all of the 

children and examining their StateSet to see if 'Selected' is among them.

HOW TO GIVE FEEDBACK

Please send your feedback to this e-mail address:

If you've found a bug, you can help us greatly by including the

following information in your e-mail:



- A program or code snippet that shows the problem.



- The platform you're using.



- The setting of your CLASSPATH environment variable (if you are using

  JDK 1.1)



- A JavaVM backtrace, if appropriate.  This will tell us what the portion

  of the Access Bridge that is running inside the JavaVM is doing when the

  bug occurs. To generate a backtrace, do this:

  

  1. Go to the shell window in which you entered the 'java' command.



  2. Make sure it has the keyboard focus and that the interpreter

     ('java' command) isn't a background process.



  3. Enter the appropriate character:



         Control-\              (Solaris)

         Control-Break          (Win 95/NT)



  4. Text will be displayed in the window.  Please put a copy of it into 

     your e-mail.





*As used in this document, the terms "Java virtual machine" or "JVM" mean 

a virtual machine for the Java platform.
