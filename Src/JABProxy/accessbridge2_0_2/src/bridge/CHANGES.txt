===============================

Changes to the Java (TM) Access Bridge for the Microsoft Windows 

Operating System

v2.0.1

===============================


-------------------

changes since 2.0

-------------------

EventQueueMonitor no longer registers as a mouse motion listener. 
The Access Bridge does not forward mouse motion events to assistive
technologies, so the listener is not needed. In addition, the listener
can interfer with 2-D rendering in some applications.

changes since 1.0.1

-------------------



Fixed a regression with retrieval of ranges of text with

the GetAccessibleTextRange() call.  This problem resulted

in the JAWS for Windows screen reader being unable to 

read the contents of editable text components, as JAWS used

the GetAccessibleTextRange() call to retrieve text from

editable text components.



Fixed bug ID 4516111 - JAWS doesn't read Swing apps under 

JDK 1.4



Fixed bug ID 4408524 - GetAccessibleTextRect() returns bogus 

values for carets at the edge of a line



Added fixes to the installer to work with JDK 1.3.1_01 and 1.4.





-----------------

changes since 1.0

-----------------



Fixed crash when calling shutdownAccessBridge() from the Windows

assistive technology when it was not itself exiting (e.g. for

cases such as temporarily unloading the Java Access Bridge

during Windows desktop switches).



Fixed menu timing problem with Java 2 SDK 1.3 (which caused

the Java Access Bridge data stream to become corrupted if it

was generating AccessibleState events when the user arrowed

between menus).



Modified the Installer so that the "Install" button is 

only active when a JVM* is selected to install into.  Also 

added an "Install in All" button which will install the

Java Access Bridge into all of the Java VMs shown in the

dialog box.



Fixed problem with using AWT components in a Java 2 SDK 1.3

environment (the Java Accessibility implementation is only

partial on AWT in SDK 1.3, and can legally return null in

a number of cases).



The bounding rectangle returned for characters through the

call: GetAccessibleTextRect() is now in global coordinates.

"JVM" mean a virtual machine for the Java platform.
