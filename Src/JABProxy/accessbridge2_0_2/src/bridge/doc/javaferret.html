<h2>

Setup</h2>



Configure your Java VM environment as directed in the <a href="setup.html">Setup

and Compatibility Info</a> page.

<br>

&nbsp;

<h2>

Trying It Out</h2>



Now that your system is configured, any time you launch a Java application

or applet using the configured Java VM, the Java Access Bridge is 

automatically

launched as well.&nbsp; Then, to use <tt>JavaFerret</tt>, launch the

<tt>JavaFerret</tt>

Windows application.&nbsp; For example, to launch <tt>JavaFerret</tt> with the <tt>SwingSet2 Demo</tt>

Swing program, using Windows Explorer: <br>





<p><tt>&nbsp; Go to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02\demo\jfc\SwingSet2</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp; Double click on the file SwingSet2.jar</tt>

</p>

<p>In Windows Explorer:

</p>

<p><tt>&nbsp; Go to C:\Program Files\Java Access Bridge</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp; Double click on the file JavaFerret.exe</tt>

</p>

<p>You now have two windows open: the <tt>SwingSet2Demo</tt> Java application

window, and the <tt>JavaFerret</tt> window.&nbsp; JavaFerret has three

interesting menus: "UpdateSettings" "JavaEvents" and 

"AccessibilityEvents".&nbsp;

The items in these menus allow you to query Java applications in a variety

of ways.

<br>&nbsp;

</p>

<h3>

UpdateSettings Menu</h3>





<blockquote>

<h3>

Update from Mouse</h3>

Determines the (x,y) coordinate of the mouse (assuming the <tt>JavaFerret</tt>

window is topmost) when the mouse has stopped moving, and then queries

the Java Access Bridge for the Accessible object underneath the mouse,

dumping the output into the scrolling window.

  <h3>

Update with F2 (Mouse HWND)</h3>



Determines the (x,y) coordinate of the mouse (assuming the <tt>JavaFerret</tt>

window is topmost), and then queries the Java Access Bridge for the Accessible

object of the HWND underneath the mouse, dumping the output into the scrolling

window.



<h3>

Update with F1 (Mouse Point)</h3>

Determines the (x,y) coordinate of the mouse (assuming the <tt>JavaFerret</tt>

window is topmost), and then queries the Java Access Bridge for the Accessible

object underneath the mouse, dumping the output into the scrolling window.

<br>&nbsp;

  <br>

</blockquote>

<h3>JavaEvents Menu</h3>





<blockquote>

<h3>

Track Mouse Events</h3>

Register with the Java Access Bridge for all Java 'Mouse Entered' events,

and upon receiving one, query the object which was entered by the mouse

and dump the output into the scrolling window. <b>Note: </b>If the mouse is 

moved quickly, there may be some delay before the displayed information is 

updated.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track Focus Events</h3>

Register with the Java Access Bridge for all Java 'Focus Gained' events,

and upon receiving one, query the object which received the focus and dump

the output into the scrolling window.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track Caret Events</h3>

Register with the Java Access Bridge for all Java 'Caret Update' events,

and upon receiving one, query the object in which the caret was updated,

and dump the output into the scrolling window.&nbsp; <b>Note: </b>Since objects

that contain carets are virtually by definition objects which are rich

text objects, this won't seem as responsive as the other event tracking

options.&nbsp; In real use, one would make fewer calls of the Java Access

Bridge in Caret Update situations (e.g. just get the new letter, word,

sentence at the caret location), which would be significantly faster.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track Menu Selected | Deselected | Canceled Events</h3>

Register with the Java Access Bridge for the various Menu events, and upon

receiving one, query the object in which the caret was updated, and dump

the output into the scrolling window.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track Popup Visible | Invisible | Canceled Events</h3>

Register with the Java Access Bridge for the various Popup Menu events,

and upon receiving one, query the object in which the caret was updated,

and dump the output into the scrolling window.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track Shutdown Events</h3>

Register with the Java Access Bridge to receive a 'Property Changed' event

when a Java application terminates.</blockquote>





<h3>AccessibilityEvents Menu</h3>





<blockquote>

<h3>

Track Name Property Events</h3>

Register with the Java Access Bridge for all Java 'Property Changed' events

with information about the property that changed.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track Description Property Events</h3>

has changed, and upon receiving one, dump the output into the scrolling

window, along with information about the property that changed.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track State Property Events</h3>

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>

Track Selection Property Events</h3>
