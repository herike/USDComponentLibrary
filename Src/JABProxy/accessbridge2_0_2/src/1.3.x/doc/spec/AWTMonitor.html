<p>The AWTMonitor example allows you to obtain information about AWT objects
being displayed on the screen by a particular Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
Virtual Machine. It does not require the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc">Java
Foundation Classes</a> to run.
<p>For those interested in detail on the additional accessibility features
of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc">Java Foundation Classes</a>,
we recommend using <a href="JavaMonitor.html">JavaMonitor</a> instead of
AWTMonitor. JavaMonitor provides all the capabilities of AWTMonitor, but
also has additional support for the JFC classes.

<h3>
Preparing To Run AWTMonitor with JDK1.1:</h3>
To run AWTMonitor with JDK1.1, you need to have obtained and installed
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html">JFC
1.1 with Swing 1.1</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">JDK1.1.6</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities Version
1.1.
<p>AWTMonitor is in the <tt>examples/AWTMonitor</tt> directory included
with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/AWTMonitor/AWTMonitor.java">here</a>
to view the source). The compiled classes of AWTMonitor are also included
in the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file includes with this release.&nbsp;
Before you can run it, you need to set up your environment appropriately
by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Add the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> files to
your CLASSPATH environment variable.</li>

<li>
Modify your <tt>$JDKHOME/lib/awt.properties</tt> file to include the following
lines:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>AWT.EventQueueClass=com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor
AWT.assistive_technologies=AWTMonitor</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run AWTMonitor.&nbsp;
If you did not set up your CLASSPATH correctly you might get one of the
following errors when running a Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
application:
<pre>Failed loading com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor:&nbsp;
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor</pre>

<pre>Error trying to newInstance AWTMonitor java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
AWTMonitor</pre>
The first error means the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> file is not in your CLASSPATH,
and the second means the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file is not in your
CLASSPATH.
<h3>
Preparing to Run AWTMonitor with JDK1.2 or later:</h3>
To run AWTMonitor with JDK1.2 or later you need to have obtained and installed
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2">JDK1.2</a>
or later. In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities
Version 1.2 or later.
<p>The AWTMonitor class is in the <tt>examples/AWTMonitor</tt> directory
included with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/AWTMonitor/AWTMonitor.java">here</a>
to view the source). Before you can run it, you need to set up your environment
appropriately by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Copy <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> to the <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/ext</tt>
directory under your JDK1.2 or later installation.</li>

<li>
Modify (create one if it doesn't exist) your <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/accessibility.properties</tt>
file to include the following line:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>assistive_technologies=AWTMonitor</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run AWTMonitor.
<h3>
Running AWTMonitor with both JDK1.1, JDK1.2 and later:</h3>
By following the instructions above, AWTMonitor will automatically be started
any time you start a Java application.&nbsp; For example, you can run the
SwingSet demo that comes as part of the demonstration applications for
Swing.
<h3>
Using AWTMonitor:</h3>
AWTMonitor provides a several rows of checkboxes at the top of its dialog
box. These allow you to specify the classes of user interface events you
can monitor in the Java Virtual Machine. AWTMonitor registers an interest
in the events by using calls to the <a href="api/com/sun/java/accessibility/util/AWTEventMonitor.html">AWTEventMonitor</a>
class from the Java Accessibility Utilities package whenever you click
one of the checkboxes.
<p>In the middle of the dialog box is a List of events that is updated
as each event occurs. Items will be posted in this List only if you selecting
the events you are interested in by manipulating the checkboxes at the
top of the box.
<p>In the bottom left of the dialog box is a small List box that represents
the last object to have focus. It is updated each time the focus changes
and contains a small sample of the information obtained from the Java Accessibility
API. NOTE: This box will not be updated unless you select for Focus events.
<p>In the lower right of the dialog box is a small List box that you can
populate by moving the pointer over an object and pressing the F1 key.
This uses calls to <tt><a href="api/com/sun/java/accessibility/util/EventQueueMonitor.html">EventQueueMonitor</a></tt>
to obtain the current mouse position and obtain an accessible object from
that point. It then calls a small number of methods from the java Accessibility
API to display information about the object under the pointer. NOTE: This
box will not be updated unless you select for key events.
