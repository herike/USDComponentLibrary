<p>Like a monkey, Monkey "swings" through the component trees in a particular
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Virtual Machine and presents the
hierarchy in two different ways. The first is the actual Component hierarchy
and the second is the hierarchy viewed as Accessible objects.&nbsp; In
addition, if the user clicks the right mouse button over a tree node in
Monkey, Monkey will present the user with a popup menu containing options
for manipulating the object.

<h3>
Preparing to Run Monkey with JDK1.1:</h3>
To run Monkey with JDK1.1, you need to have obtained and installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html">JFC
1.1 with Swing 1.1</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">JDK1.1.6</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities Version
1.1.
<p>The Monkey class is in the <tt>examples/Monkey</tt> directory included
with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/Monkey/Monkey.java">here</a>
to view the source). The compiled classes of Monkey are also included in
the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file includes with this release.&nbsp;
Before you can run Monkey, you need to set up your environment appropriately
by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Add the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> files to
your CLASSPATH environment variable.</li>

<li>
Modify your <tt>$JDKHOME/lib/awt.properties</tt> file to include the following
lines:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>AWT.EventQueueClass=com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor
AWT.assistive_technologies=Monkey</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run Monkey.&nbsp;
If you did not set up your CLASSPATH correctly you might get one of the
following errors when running a Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
application:
<pre>Failed loading com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor:&nbsp;
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor</pre>

<pre>Error trying to newInstance Monkey java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
Monkey</pre>
The first error means the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> file is not in your CLASSPATH,
and the second means the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file is not in your
CLASSPATH.
<h3>
Preparing to Run Monkey with JDK1.2 or later:</h3>
To run Monkey with JDK1.2 or later you need to have obtained and installed
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/products/jdk/1.2">JDK1.2</a>
or later. In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities
Version 1.2 or later.
<p>The Monkey class is in the <tt>examples/Monkey</tt> directory included
with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/Monkey/Monkey.java">here</a>
to view the source). Before you can run it, you need to set up your environment
appropriately by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Copy <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> to the <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/ext</tt>
directory under your JDK1.2 or later installation.</li>

<li>
Modify (create one if it doesn't exist) your <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/accessibility.properties</tt>
file to include the following line:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>assistive_technologies=Monkey</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run Monkey.
<h3>
Running Monkey with JDK1.1, JDK1.2 or later:</h3>
By following the instructions above, Monkey will automatically be started
any time you start a Java application. For example, you can run the SwingSet
demo that comes as part of the demonstration applications for Swing.
<h3>
Using Monkey:</h3>
In its "File" menu, Monkey provides a "Refresh Trees" item. When you select
this, Monkey will ask the EventQueueMonitor for the current list of top
level windows it has detected in the virtual machine. It will then display
the component hierarchy of the top level windows using two different formats.
On the left side of its window, Monkey will display the "true" component
hierarchy. On the right hand side of its window, Monkey will display the
hierarchy as though the objects are Accessible objects.&nbsp; If you right
click on a node in the right hand side of its window, Monkey will display
a popup menu that provides options for you to get additional accessible
information from the object.&nbsp; The first option will provide you with
information similar to that provided by the <a href="Explorer.html">Explorer</a>
example.&nbsp; The second option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleActions
of the object, the third option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleSelections
of the object, and the fourth option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleHypertext
links of the object. You can bring up an AccessibilityPanel without using
the mouse by first selecting the table cell you are interested in, and
then choosing the AccessibilityPanel from the Panels menu.

<p>Depending upon when it starts, the initial list displayed by Monkey
may not accurately reflect the current state of the Java Virtual Machine.
To update the display, select the "Refresh Trees" item in Monkey's "File"
menu.&nbsp; At any time, you can press the F1 key and Monkey will automatically
refresh the trees as well.
