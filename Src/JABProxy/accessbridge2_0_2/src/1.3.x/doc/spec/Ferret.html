<p>Based on user settings (in the Settings menu), Ferret tracks mouse movement,
focus updates, and text caret movement in a particular Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
Virtual Machine. If set to do so, when it detects that the mouse has stopped
moving for a short period of time, it calls EventQueueMonitor's method,
getAccessibleAt, to determine the Accessible object under the mouse. Once
it has done so, it displays the Accessible information of that object.
Similarly, if set to do so, when it detects that a new UI object has the
focus, it displays the Accessible information for that new UI object. Further,
if set to do so, it will display the Accessible information for the text
object containing the caret when the caret moves. Finally, if set to do
so, it will call EventQueueMonitor's method, getAccessibleAt, to determine
the Accessible object under the mouse when the user the F1 key, and then
display the Accessible information of that object.

<h3>
Preparing to Run Ferret with JDK1.1:</h3>
To run Ferret with JDK1.1, you need to have obtained and installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html">JFC
1.1 with Swing 1.1</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">JDK1.1.6</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities Version
1.1.
<p>The Ferret class is in the <tt>examples/Ferret</tt> directory included
with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/Ferret/Ferret.java">here</a>
to view the source). The compiled classes of Ferret are also included in
the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file includes with this release.&nbsp;
Before you can run Ferret, you need to set up your environment appropriately
by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Add the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> files to
your CLASSPATH environment variable.</li>

<li>
Modify your <tt>$JDKHOME/lib/awt.properties</tt> file to include the following
lines:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>AWT.EventQueueClass=com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor
AWT.assistive_technologies=Ferret</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run Ferret.&nbsp;
If you did not set up your CLASSPATH correctly you might get one of the
following errors when running a Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
application:
<pre>Failed loading com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor:&nbsp;
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor</pre>

<pre>Error trying to newInstance Ferret java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;

Ferret</pre>
The first error means the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> file is not in your CLASSPATH,
and the second means the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file is not in your
CLASSPATH.
<h3>
Running Ferret with JDK1.2 and later:</h3>
To run Ferret with JDK1.2 you need to have obtained and installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2">JDK1.2</a>
or later. In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities
Version 1.2 or later.
<p>The Ferret class is in the <tt>examples/Ferret</tt> directory included
with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/AccessibilityMonitor/Ferret.java">here</a>
to view the source). Before you can run it, you need to set up your environment
appropriately by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Copy <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> to the <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/ext</tt>
directory under your JDK1.2 or later installation.</li>

<li>
Modify (create one if it doesn't exist) your <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/accessibility.properties</tt>
file to include the following line:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>assistive_technologies=Ferret</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run Ferret.
<h3>
Running Ferret with JDK1.1, JDK1.2 or later:</h3>
By following the instructions above, Ferret will automatically be started
any time you start a Java application. For example, you can run the SwingSet
demo that comes as part of the demonstration applications for Swing.
<h3>
Using Ferret:</h3>
Choose the mechanism(s) you want to use Ferret by making selections from
the Settings menu. Until you tell Ferret how to explore, it will remain
quiescent. To automatically explore the Java Accessibility API of the object
under the mouse as the mouse moves, choose "Track Mouse" from the Settings
menu. To automatically explore the Java Accessibility API of the object
receiving focus, choose "Track Focus" from the Settings menu. To automatically
explore the Java Accessibility API of the text object in which caret movements
are occuring, choose "TrackCaret". Finally, to explore the Java Accessibility
API of objects under the mouse upon command when you hit the F1 key on
your keyboard, choose "Update with F1 key" from the Settings menu.
