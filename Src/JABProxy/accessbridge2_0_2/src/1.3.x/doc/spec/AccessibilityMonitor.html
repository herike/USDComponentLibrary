<p>The AccessibilityMonitor example allows you to obtain information about
the objects being displayed on the screen by a particular Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
Virtual Machine, and includes options to obtain additional accessibility
features provided by the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc">Java
Foundation Classes</a>.

<h3>
Preparing to Run AccessibilityMonitor with JDK1.1:</h3>
To run AccessibilityMonitor with JDK1.1, you need to have obtained and
installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html">JFC 1.1
with Swing 1.1</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">JDK1.1.6</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities Version
1.1.
<p>The AccessibilityMonitor class is in the <tt>examples/AccessibilityMonitor</tt>
directory included with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities
(click <a href="../examples/AccessibilityMonitor/AccessibilityMonitor.java">here</a>
to view the source). Before you can run it, you need to set up your environment
appropriately by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Add the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> files to
your CLASSPATH environment variable.</li>

<li>
Modify your <tt>$JDKHOME/lib/awt.properties</tt> file to include the following
lines:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>AWT.EventQueueClass=com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor
AWT.assistive_technologies=AccessibilityMonitor</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run AccessibilityMonitor.&nbsp;
If you did not set up your CLASSPATH correctly you might get one of the
following errors when running a Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
application:
<pre>Failed loading com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor:&nbsp;
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor</pre>

<pre>Error trying to newInstance AccessibilityMonitor java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
AccessibilityMonitor</pre>
The first error means the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> file is not in your CLASSPATH,
and the second means the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file is not in your
CLASSPATH.
<h3>
Preparing to Run AccessibilityMonitor with JDK1.2 or later:</h3>
To run AccessibilityMonitor with JDK1.2 or later you need to have obtained
and installed
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2">JDK1.2</a>
or later.&nbsp; In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility
Utilities Version 1.2 or later.
<p>The AccessibilityMonitor class is in the <tt>examples/AccessibilityMonitor</tt>
directory included with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities
(click <a href="../examples/AccessibilityMonitor/AccessibilityMonitor.java">here</a>
to view the source). Before you can run it, you need to set up your environment
appropriately by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Copy <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> to the <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/ext</tt>
directory under your JDK1.2 or later installation.</li>

<li>
Modify (create one if it doesn't exist) your <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/accessibility.properties</tt>
file to include the following line:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>assistive_technologies=AccessibilityMonitor</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run AccessibilityMonitor.
<h3>
Running AccessibilityMonitor with both JDK1.1, JDK1.2 and later:</h3>
By following the instructions above, AccessibilityMonitor will automatically
be started any time you start a Java application. For example, you can
run the SwingSet demo that comes as part of the demonstration applications
for Swing.
<h3>
Using AccessibilityMonitor:</h3>
AccessibilityMonitor contains at the top a check box, which, when checked,
causes AccessibilityMonitor to monitor all PropertyChange events on all
of the non-transient Accessible user interface objects in the Java Virtual
Machine. Transient user interface objects are those which are only created
in response to a query of their parent (or a more distant ancestor), but
which don't otherwise have a life of their own in the Java Virtual Machine
(for example cells of a table or list, which aren't actual AWT components
except for the brief moment in time during which they are drawn to the
screen). Transient objects contain the AccessibleState.TRANSIENT state
in their AccessibleStateSet.&nbsp; AccessibilityMonitor registers an interest
in the events by using calls to the AccessibilityEventMonitor class from
the Java Accessibility Utilities package whenever you click on the "Accessibility
PropertyChange Events" checkbox.
<p>The bulk of the window contains a table listing the PropertyChange events
that is updated periodically as the events occur. The first column of the
table contains the Accessible Name of the object which generated the event
(these will often be blank as many objects [generally container objects]
don't have Accessible names). The second column contains the name of the
property which changed (generating the event). The third and fourth columns
contain string representations of the old and new values (respectively)
of that property.

<p>Holding down the right-most mouse button on an event in either the first
or second row of the table will display a popup menu that provides options
for you to get additional accessible information from the object.&nbsp;
The first option will provide you with information similar to that provided
by the <a href="Explorer.html">Explorer</a> example.&nbsp; The second option
allows you to manipulate the AccessibleActions of the object, the third
option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleSelections of the object,
and the fourth option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleHypertext
links of the object.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you hold down the right-most mouse
button on either the third or fourth column, the same menu will appear
if and only if either the value (old or new) represents an Accessible object
itself (e.g. if the AccessibleChild property is the type of event, then
the event represents either the birth or death of an AccessibleChild of
the object which generated the event), and the panels which come up are
for that old or new Accessible object. You can bring up an AccessibilityPanel
without using the mouse by first selecting the table cell you are interested
in, and then choosing the AccessibilityPanel from the Panels menu.
