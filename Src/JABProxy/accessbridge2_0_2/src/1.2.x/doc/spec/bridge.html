The Java Accessibility Bridge to Native Code&nbsp;
<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"></h2>
In order for existing assistive technologies available on host systems
(e.g. Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, OS/2) to provide access to Java applications,
they need some way to communicate with the Java Accessibility support in
those Java applications. The Java Accessibility Bridge supports that communication.
This bridge is a class which contains "native methods."&nbsp; Part of the
code for the class is actually supplied by a DLL on the host system - Solaris,
OS/2, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, etc. The assistive technology running
on the host (e.g., a Macintosh screen reader) communicates with the Macintosh
native DLL portion of the bridge class, which in turn communicates with
the Java Virtual Machine, and from there to the Java Accessibility utility
support and the Java Accessibility API on the individual user interface
objects of the Java application it is providing access to.
<p>A diagram of how all of these components work together is shown below.

</ul>
For example, in order for a screen reader for Microsoft Windows to provide
access to Java applications running on that system, that screen reader
would make calls to the Java Accessibility Bridge for Microsoft Windows.
If/when a the user launched a Java application, the bridge would inform
the screen reader of this fact. Then the screen reader would query the
bridge about the Java application and the bridge would in turn forward
those queries on to the Java Accessibility Utilities that were loaded into
the Java Virtual Machine, and in many cases on to the individual user interface
object that implemented the Java Accessibility API. When those answers
came back to the bridge, the bridge would forward them on to the screen
reader for Microsoft Windows, which would then use the answers to tell
the user what was going on in the Java application.
