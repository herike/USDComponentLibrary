<h3>Setting Up the Java Access Bridge</h3>

<blockquote>The Java Access Bridge should only be installed by hand as

a last resort. The recommended way to install the Java Access Bridge

is to use the Java Access Bridge installer, which will locate the Java

VMs installed on your system that support the Java Access Bridge,

and then install the Java Access Bridge into those Java VMs that you identify.  The Java Access

Bridge installer is a self-extracting executable file called AccessBridge-2_0_1.exe.

<p>The instructions below describe what the Java Access Bridge installer

does, allowing you to make those modifications by hand if necessary.&nbsp;

Please note: the Java Access Bridge package includes three editions

of the Java Accessibility Utilities file '<tt>jaccess.jar</tt>', which

differs for Java 2 SDK 1.2, Java 2 SDK 1.3, and Java 2 SDK 1.4.  These files are named <tt>jaccess-1_2.jar</tt>, <tt>jaccess-1_3.jar</tt>, and <tt>jaccess-1_4.jar</tt>.

Please use the <tt>jaccess-1_4.jar</tt> for Java 2 SDK 5.0.

<br>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<blockquote>

<b><font size="+1">Using JDK 1.1 Environments</font></b><br>

Version 1.0.2 of the Java Access Bridge is required for JDK 1.1 environments.  See <a href="compatibility.html">the compatibility table</a> for complete information.





<p><b><font size="+1">Using Java Environments (Including SDK v1.2.2, v1.3.x, v1.4.x, and v5.0)</font></b>

</p><p>To begin the installation, locate your Java platform extensions

directory, which is the jre\lib\ext subdirectory under the directory in

which your JDK is installed. Typical locations are:

</p><p><tt>&nbsp; c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0\jre\lib\ext<br>

&nbsp; c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_05\lib\ext<br>

</tt>

</p><p>Copy the following files into that directory:

<br><tt>&nbsp; jaccess-1_2.jar</tt> for Java 2 platform edition 

1.2.x,&nbsp; <i><b>or</b></i> <br><tt>&nbsp; jaccess-1_3.jar</tt> for Java 2 platform edition

1.3.x,&nbsp; <i><b>or</b></i> <br><tt>&nbsp; jaccess-1_4.jar</tt> for Java 2 platform edition 1.4.x,&nbsp; <i><b>or</b></i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>jaccess-1_4.jar</tt> for Java platform edition 1.5.x; &nbsp; <i><b>and</b></i> <br><tt>&nbsp; access-bridge.jar</tt>.&nbsp; 

</p>The Java Virtual Machine consults a number of property files as it starts

up.&nbsp; You will need to modify the&nbsp;<tt>c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_05\lib\ext\</tt><tt>accessibility.properties</tt>

file in order to enable accessibility.&nbsp; The <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/jaccess-1.2/doc/examples.html">Java

Accessibility Utilities examples</a> documentation explains how this all

works. Add the following line to the <tt>accessibility.properties</tt>

file:

<p><tt>&nbsp; assistive_technologies=com.sun.java.accessibility.AccessBridge</tt>

</p><p>This line tells the Java VM to load the <tt>AccessBridge</tt> assistive

technology, which it finds in the standard extensions directory.  In addition,

if you are using screen magnification technologies such as ZoomText from

Ai Squared, you must also indicate the presence of screen magnification by

adding the following line to the <tt>accessibility.properties</tt> file:

</p><p><tt>&nbsp; screen_magnifier_present=true</tt>

<br>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<b><font size="+1">Compatibility Information</font></b>

<blockquote>In the Java Foundation Classes 1.1 with Swing 1.1, the name

of the packages containing both the Swing classes and the Java Accessibility

API classes changed (from com.sun.java.swing and com.sun.java.accessibility

to javax.swing and javax.accessibility respectively).&nbsp; Java applications

and applets built with earlier versions of Swing and/or the Java Accessibility

API will not work with the Java Accessibility Utilities version 1.1 and later, nor

will they work with the Java Access Bridge.&nbsp; The <a href="compatibility.html">compatibility

table</a> details the versions of the Java platform, Java Foundation Classes,

Java Accessibility Utilities, Java Plugin, and Java Access Bridge that work

with each other.

<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<b><font size="+1">Working From a Browser</font></b>

<blockquote>The Java Plugin, at <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin">http://java.sun.com/products/plugin</a>,

provides a browser plug-in that contains the Sun Java VM.&nbsp; This VM

includes the ability to replace the EventQueue in order to load assistive

technologies (or, in the case of the JDK 1.2 version&nbsp; of the Java

Plugin; load assistive technologies directly). The Java Plugin (version

1.2.2 and later) includes the Java Foundation Classes (and thereby Swing

and the Java Accessibility API).&nbsp; The Java Plugin is typically installed

on your c:\ drive within your Program Files directory.&nbsp; It may be

a separate, or second Java VM.&nbsp; The Java platform extensions directory

is typically at:

<p><tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt>c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_05\lib\ext</tt>

</p><p>which is where you must put the <tt>accessbridge.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess.jar</tt>

files.&nbsp; The parent lib directory is where the <tt>accessibility.properties</tt>

file is located, which must be likewise modified as above.
