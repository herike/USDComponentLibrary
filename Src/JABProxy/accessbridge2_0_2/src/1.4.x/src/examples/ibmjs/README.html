<h4><font face="Arial">Overview</font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial">Speech for Java is a Java programming
interface for speech that gives Java application developers
access to the </font><a href="http://www.ibm.com/viavoice/"><font
face="Arial">IBM ViaVoice</font></a><font face="Arial"> speech
technology. Speech for Java supports voice command recognition,
dictation, and text-to-speech synthesis, based on the IBM
ViaVoice technology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Speech for Java is an alpha implementation
of a core subset of the beta Java Speech API. The Java Speech API
is a cross-platform Speech API that was developed by Sun
Microsystems Inc. in collaboration with IBM and other industry
speech technology companies. More information on the Java Speech
API can be found at the </font><a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/speech/"><font
face="Arial">Java Speech API home page</font></a><font
face="Arial">.</font></p>

<h4><font face="Arial">Changes from version 0.6</font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial">There have been some relatively minor
changes to the API. The only change needed for the Hello program
is that the RuleResult.getFinalRuleResult method has been
removed; the FinalRuleResult object is now obtained from the
RuleResult object by casting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In addition, a tentative method for
persistently registering vendor engines (such as the IBM ViaVoice
synthesis and recognition engine) with the system has been
defined. In version 0.6, because there was no such mechanism, we
instead adopted the temporary expedient of hard-coding the IBM
engine into the system classes. Because of this change in version
0.7, it is now necessary to run an install script, found in
install.bat, before running any Java Speech applications, in
order to register the IBM engines with the system.</font></p>

<h4><font face="Arial">Requirements</font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial">In much the same way that Java
implementations on Windows are built on top of the native Windows
GUI capabilities, Speech for Java is built on top of the native
speech recognition and synthesis capabilities in IBM ViaVoice.
Thus Speech for Java requires installation of IBM ViaVoice Gold
on your computer. ViaVoice is not provided as part of this
package. You may find more information about ViaVoice at the </font><a
href="http://www.software.ibm.com/viavoice"><font face="Arial">VoiceType
/ ViaVoice Home Page</font></a><font face="Arial">.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Your computer should meet the minimum
requirements for running IBM ViaVoice (166MHz Pentium or 150MHz
Pentium with MMX, running Windows 95 with 32MB of memory or
Windows NT with 48MB). The Speech for Java implementation will
take advantage of any enrollment, dictation macros, and added
words in your ViaVoice installation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We have only tested Speech for Java on the
JavaSoft JDK 1.1.5 version of Java. We recommed that you use this
version if possible.</font></p>

<h4><font face="Arial">Installation</font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial">After unpacking the installation package to
its own directory you should have the following files: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#C0C0C0"
    bordercolor="#FFFFFF">
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">README.html</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">This file</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">install.bat</font></td>
            <td><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">Installation script</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">lib\ibmjs.jar</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">The Java portion of the Speech
            for Java implementation</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">lib\ibm*.dll</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">The native portion of the
            Speech for Java implementation </font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">hello\</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">The Hello sample application</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">ref\</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">Java Speech API reference
            documentation. See </font><a href="#ref"><font
            face="Arial">index</font></a><font face="Arial">.</font></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">Suppose you have unpacked the installation
package to c:\ibmjs. You should</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">modify your CLASSPATH variable to
        include c:\ibmjs\lib\ibmjs.jar, and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">modify your PATH variable to include
        the c:\ibmjs\lib directory</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">from c:\ibmjs, execute install.bat to
        register the IBM engines with the system.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Alternatively you may set these environment
variables just before running the Java virtual machine, as
illustrated by the hello.bat file in the hello directory. Also,
if you neglect to run install.bat, hello.bat will also register
the IBM engines with the system.</font></p>

<h4><font face="Arial">Using the Hello sample</font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial">Note: the following description is written
assuming that your language is English. The Hello program also
now supports French and German. Look at the corresponding
hello*.gram and res*.properties files to find the equivalent
instructions for other languages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note: the Hello program requires a
full-duplex sound card and driver. Some older sound cards and
older drivers don't support simultaneous audio output (synthesis)
and audio input (recognition). For some notes on working around
this problem, please see the </font><a
href="http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/context/communityXchange"><font
face="Arial">Community eXchange</font></a><font face="Arial">
section of the alphaWorks site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To test your installation, open a command
prompt, cd to the hello directory, and run the hello batch file.
This will set the PATH and CLASSPATH variables, and start the
Hello program. The program will start out by saying &quot;Hello
human, my name is Computer, what is your name?&quot; At this
point the program is in command mode, and you may say one of the
following: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <table border="0" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
        <tr>
            <th align="left"><font face="Arial">You say</font></th>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <th align="left"><font face="Arial">Program does</font></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">&quot;My name is <em>first
            last&quot;</em></font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">Says &quot;Hello <em>first
            last</em>&quot;</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">&quot;Goodbye&quot;</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">Says &quot;Bye now&quot; and
            exits</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">&quot;Repeat after me&quot;</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">Enters dictation mode</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial">&quot;That's all&quot;</font></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><font face="Arial">Leaves dictation mode and
            repeats what you said </font></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that since this is just a simple
example, the Hello application has a very limited range of <em>first</em>
and <em>last</em> names that it understands. You can look at the
appropriate hello*.gram file to see which names it knows. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You may add your own name by modifying
hello.gram and then restarting the Hello program. To add your own
name, follow the pattern that you see in hello.gram. For example,
if your name is John Doe, try adding a line that says &quot;|
John {John}&quot; to the rule for &lt;first&gt;, and similarly
for &lt;last&gt;. You should now be able to say &quot;My name is
John Doe&quot; and get an appropriate response. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The part in curly brackets in hello.gram is
a tag. Tags are general-purpose mechanism of the Java Speech
Grammar Format (JSGF); in this sample it is used to determine how
the computer says your name. Try modifying the tag for your name
and restarting the hello program, and see what the computer says
when you say &quot;My name is ...&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">While in command mode, you can say
&quot;Repeat after me&quot;, at which point the computer will
enter dictation mode and say &quot;I'm listening&quot;. You may
now dictate any text you like and finish by saying &quot;That's
all&quot;, at which point the program will repeat what you said
and go back into command mode. </font></p>

<h4><a name="ref"></a><font face="Arial">For more information</font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial">The source of the Hello program is included
to help you understand the basics of writing a speech application
using the Speech for Java. The following reference documentation
is also provided:</font></p>
