<h3>Starting AccessibilityMonitor</h3>
If you have completed the actions listed in <a href="examples.html#before">
Before Using the Examples</a>, AccessibilityMonitor starts automatically any 
time you start a Java application.

<h3>
Using AccessibilityMonitor</h3>
AccessibilityMonitor contains at the top a check box, which, when checked,
causes AccessibilityMonitor to monitor all PropertyChange events on all
of the non-transient Accessible user interface objects in the Java Virtual
Machine. Transient user interface objects are those which are only created
in response to a query of their parent (or a more distant ancestor), but
which don't otherwise have a life of their own in the Java Virtual Machine
(for example cells of a table or list, which aren't actual AWT components
except for the brief moment in time during which they are drawn to the
screen). Transient objects contain the AccessibleState.TRANSIENT state
in their AccessibleStateSet.&nbsp; AccessibilityMonitor registers an interest
in the events by using calls to the AccessibilityEventMonitor class from
the Java Accessibility Utilities package whenever you click on the "Accessibility
PropertyChange Events" checkbox.
<p>The bulk of the window contains a table listing the PropertyChange events
that is updated periodically as the events occur. The first column of the
table contains the Accessible Name of the object which generated the event
(these will often be blank as many objects [generally container objects]
don't have Accessible names). The second column contains the name of the
property which changed (generating the event). The third and fourth columns
contain string representations of the old and new values (respectively)
of that property.

<p>Holding down the right-most mouse button on an event in either the first
or second row of the table will display a popup menu that provides options
for you to get additional accessible information from the object.&nbsp;
The first option will provide you with information similar to that provided
by the <a href="Ferret.html">Ferret</a> example.&nbsp; The second option
allows you to manipulate the AccessibleActions of the object, the third
option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleSelections of the object,
and the fourth option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleHypertext
links of the object.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you hold down the right-most mouse
button on either the third or fourth column, the same menu will appear
if and only if either the value (old or new) represents an Accessible object
itself (e.g. if the AccessibleChild property is the type of event, then
the event represents either the birth or death of an AccessibleChild of
the object which generated the event), and the panels which come up are
for that old or new Accessible object. You can bring up an AccessibilityPanel
without using the mouse by first selecting the table cell you are interested
in, and then choosing the AccessibilityPanel from the Panels menu.
