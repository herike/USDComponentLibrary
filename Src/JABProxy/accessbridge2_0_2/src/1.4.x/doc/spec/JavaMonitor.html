<p>The JavaMonitor example allows you to obtain information about the objects
being displayed on the screen by a particular Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
Virtual Machine, and includes options to obtain additional accessibility
features provided by the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc">Java
Foundation Classes</a>.

<h3>
Preparing to Run JavaMonitor with JDK1.1:</h3>
To run JavaMonitor with JDK1.1, you need to have obtained and installed
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html">JFC
1.1 with Swing 1.1</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">JDK1.1.6</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities Version
1.1.
<p>The JavaMonitor class is in the <tt>examples/JavaMonitor</tt> directory
included with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/JavaMonitor/JavaMonitor.java">here</a>
to view the source). The compiled classes of JavaMonitor are also included
in the <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file includes with this release.&nbsp;
Before you can run JavaMonitor, you need to set up your environment appropriately
by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Add the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> files to
your CLASSPATH environment variable.</li>

<li>
Modify your <tt>$JDKHOME/lib/awt.properties</tt> file to include the following
lines:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>AWT.EventQueueClass=com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor
AWT.assistive_technologies=JavaMonitor</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run JavaMonitor.&nbsp;
If you did not set up your CLASSPATH correctly you might get one of the
following errors when running a Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
application:
<pre>Failed loading com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor:&nbsp;
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor</pre>

<pre>Error trying to newInstance JavaMonitor java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:&nbsp;
JavaMonitor</pre>
The first error means the <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> file is not in your CLASSPATH,
and the second means the
<br><tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> file is not in your CLASSPATH.
<h3>
Preparing to Run JavaMonitor with JDK1.2 or later:</h3>
To run JavaMonitor with JDK1.2 or later you need to have obtained and installed
<a href="http://java.sun.com/jdk/1.2">JDK1.2</a>
or later. In addition, you need to be using the Java Accessibility Utilities
Version 1.2 or later.
<p>The JavaMonitor class is in the <tt>examples/JavaMonitor</tt> directory
included with this release of the Java Accessibility Utilities (click <a href="../examples/JavaMonitor/JavaMonitor.java">here</a>
to view the source). Before you can run it, you need to set up your environment
appropriately by following these instructions:
<blockquote>
<li>
Copy <tt>jaccess.jar</tt> and <tt>jaccess-examples.jar</tt> to the <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/ext</tt>
directory under your JDK1.2 or later installation.</li>

<li>
Modify (create one if it doesn't exist) your <tt>$JDKHOME/jre/lib/accessibility.properties</tt>
file to include the following line:</li>

<blockquote>
<pre>assistive_technologies=JavaMonitor</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
After you follow these instructions, you should be ready to run JavaMonitor.
<h3>
Running JavaMonitor with JDK1.1, JDK1.2 and later:</h3>
By following the instructions above, JavaMonitor will automatically be
started any time you start a Java application. For example, you can run
the SwingSet demo that comes as part of the demonstration applications
for Swing.
<h3>
Using JavaMonitor:</h3>
JavaMonitor provides several rows of checkboxes at the top of its dialog
box. These checkboxes allow you to specify the classes of user interface
events that you can monitor in the Java Virtual Machine. JavaMonitor registers
an interest in the events by using calls to the <a href="api/com/sun/java/accessibility/util/SwingEventMonitor.html">SwingEventMonitor</a>
class from the Java Accessibility Utilities package whenever you click
one of the checkboxes.
<p>In the middle of the dialog box is a list of events that is updated
as each event occurs. Items will be posted in this list only if you select
the events you are interested in by manipulating the checkboxes at the
top of the box.
<p>In the bottom left of the dialog box is a small list box that represents
the last object to have focus. It is updated each time the focus changes
and contains a small sample of the information obtained from the Java Accessibility
API. NOTE: This box will not be updated unless you select for Focus events.
<p>In the lower right of the dialog box is a small List box that you can
populate by moving the pointer over an object and pressing the F1 key.
This action uses calls to <tt><a href="api/com/sun/java/accessibility/util/EventQueueMonitor.html">EventQueueMonitor</a></tt>
to obtain the current mouse position and obtain an accessible object from
that location. It then calls a small number of methods from the Java Accessibility
API to display information about the object under the pointer. NOTE: This
box will not be updated unless you select for key events.

<p>When one of the events is selected in the list, you can choose to bring
up an AccessibilityPanel from the Panels menu. This will display additional
accessible information about the object. The first option will provide
you with information similar to that provided by the <a href="Explorer.html">Explorer</a>
example.&nbsp; The second option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleActions
of the object, the third option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleSelections
of the object, and the fourth option allows you to manipulate the AccessibleHypertext
links of the object.&nbsp; You can also bring up a popup menu of AccessibilityPanels
by right-clicking over the events list.
<p><b>NOTE</b>: The JFC Menus will not show any interesting information
unless you select for JMenu events.
